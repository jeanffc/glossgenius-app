## Answers

1. What went well?
I managed the work well with Redux and the new Redux Duck Pattern that I studied to implant in the challenge. With Redux we can organize the code by functions or modules, but with Duck Pattern we can organize all this better, it is the union of actions, reducers and types in a single file of that context.

2. What did not go well?
I could not finish the mocks, I've seen the back end, but not the front end, I liked the idea, I'll study more about it.

3. If you had more time to work on this, how would you improve it? Feel free to include both
code improvements as well as other aspects of this feature that you think will make it
better.
I would end the mocks/api and the dialog box.
However I would suggest to the Designer improvements to facilitate the admin work, because it is important to think in the person behind the software, so: 
- input text to find users 
- filters by approval or refusal
- paginate
- maybe a button to view the applicant's curriculum
